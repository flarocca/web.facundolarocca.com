    MY_DESCRIPTION: (
        <span>
            I am a Software Developer who loves programming and building valuable, reliable and high quality software.<br />
            I started programming when I was sixteen using some games and an old C++ book. Little by little I got
            into this fantastic world and I learnt to build software.<br />
            When I was twenty five I got in touch with Agiles Methodologies using XP and Scrum.
            Since then I can't think about managing a project without using Agiles Methodologies.
            A couple of years later I discovered Test Driven Development, methodology that I have used until right now.<br />
            Although I have worked almost all my professional life with C# and .Net technologies, I have found in JavaScript
            and all its powerful and simplicity an incredible world which has not been totally discovered yet, and I want to.
